                 Q&A with Emmanuel Goldstein of
                 2600: The Hacker's Quarterly

                 (CNN) -- Emmanuel Goldstein is the
                 editor-in-chief of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and
                 hosts a weekly radio program in New York called
                 "Off the Hook." 

                 1. How do you define hacking? 

                      Hacking is, very simply, asking a lot of
                      questions and refusing to stop asking. This
                      is why computers are perfect for inquisitive
                      people -- they don't tell you to shut up
                      when you keep asking questions or
                      inputting commands over and over and
                      over. But hacking doesn't have to confine
                      itself to computers. Anyone with an
                      inquisitive mind, a sense of adventure and
                      strong beliefs in free speech and the right
                      to know most definitely has a bit of the
                      hacker spirit in them. 

                 2. Are there legal or appropriate forms of
                 hacking? 

                      One of the common misconceptions is that
                      anyone considered a hacker is doing
                      something illegal. It's a sad commentary on
                      the state of our society when someone who
                      is basically seeking knowledge and the truth
                      is assumed to be up to something nefarious.
                      Nothing could be further from the truth. 

                      Hackers, in their idealistic naiveté, reveal
                      the facts that they discover, without
                      regard for money, corporate secrets or
                      government coverups. We have nothing to
                      hide, which is why we're always relatively
                      open with the things we do -- whether it's
                      having meetings in a public place or running
                      a system for everyone to participate in
                      regardless of background. The fact that we
                      don't "play the game" of secrets also makes
                      hackers a tremendous threat in the eyes of
                      many who want to keep things away from
                      the public. 

                      Secrets are all well and good, but if the
                      only thing keeping them a secret is the fact
                      that you say it's a secret, then it's not
                      really a very good secret. We suggest using
                      strong encryption for those really interested
                      in keeping things out of the hands of
                      outsiders. It's interesting also that hackers
                      are the ones who are always pushing strong
                      encryption -- if we were truly interested in
                      getting into everyone's personal affairs, it's
                      unlikely we'd try and show them how to
                      stay secure. There are, however, entities
                      who are trying to weaken encryption.
                      People should look toward them with
                      concern, as they are the true threat to
                      privacy. 

                 3. What in your mind is the purpose of
                 hacking? 

                      To seek knowledge, discover something
                      new, be the first one to find a particular
                      weakness in a computer system or the first
                      to be able to get a certain result from a
                      program. As mentioned above, this doesn't
                      have to confine itself to the world of
                      computers. Anyone who's an adventurer or
                      explorer of some sort, or any good
                      investigative journalist, knows the feeling of
                      wanting to do something nobody has ever
                      done before or find the answer despite
                      being told that you can't. One thing that all
                      of the people involved in these endeavors
                      seem to share is the feeling from outsiders
                      that they're wasting their time. 

                 4. Are you a hacker? Why? Or why not? 

                      Absolutely. It's not something you can just
                      erase from your personality, nor should you
                      want to. Once you lose the desire to mess
                      around with things, tweak programs and
                      systems, or just pursue an answer doggedly
                      until you get a result, you've lost a very
                      important part of yourself. It's quite
                      possible that many "reformed" hackers will
                      lose that special ingredient as they become
                      more and more a part of some other entity
                      that demands their very souls. But for
                      those who can resist this, or figure out a
                      way to incorporate "legitimacy" into their
                      hacker personalities without compromising
                      them, there are some very interesting and
                      fun times ahead. 

                 5. What kind of hacking do you do? 

                      My main interest has always been phones
                      and rarely does a day pass when I don't
                      experiment in some way with a phone
                      system, voice mail system, pay phone, or
                      my own telephone. I've always been
                      fascinated by the fact that we're only a
                      few buttons away from virtually anyone on
                      the planet and I hope that I never lose that
                      sense of marvel. 

                      One of the most amazing things I ever got
                      involved in was routing phone calls within
                      the network itself -- known as blue-boxing.
                      You can't do that as easily any more, but it
                      was a real fun way to learn how everything
                      was connected -- operators, services,
                      countries, you name it. And in the
                      not-too-distant past, there were so many
                      different sounds phones made depending on
                      where you were calling. Now they tend to
                      be standardized rings, busies, etc. But the
                      magic hasn't disappeared, it's just moved
                      on to new things ... satellite technology,
                      new phone networks and voice recognition
                      technologies. 

                      Many times these new technologies are
                      designed by the very people who were
                      hacking the old technologies. The result is
                      usually more security and systems that
                      know what people will find useful. While I've
                      spent a great deal of time playing with
                      phones, I get the same sense of fun from
                      computer systems and have invested lots
                      of time exploring the Internet. It would fill a
                      book to outline all of the hacker potential
                      that exists out there. And, of course,
                      there's radio hacking, which predates a lot
                      of the current technology. It's gotten to
                      the point where simply listening to a certain
                      frequency has become a challenge. It's
                      hard to believe that it's actually turned into
                      a crime to listen to some of these
                      non-scrambled radio waves. But this is the
                      price we pay when people with no
                      understanding of technology are the ones in
                      charge of regulating it. 

                 6. How much time do you spend at it a week? 

                      That's like asking how much time you spend
                      breathing. It's always with you, you do
                      more of it at certain times, but it's always
                      something that's going on in your head.
                      Even when I sleep, I dream from a hacker
                      perspective. 

                 7. Do you have a certain kind of site or
                 "target" sites that most attract you? 

                      We don't sit around with a big map and a
                      list of targets. In fact, we don't even sit
                      around together. Most hacking is done by
                      individuals who simply find things by
                      messing around and making discoveries. We
                      share that info and others add input. Then
                      someone tells the press and the
                      government that we're plotting to move
                      satellites and all hell breaks loose. 

                      I think most of us tend to be drawn to the
                      sites and systems that are said to be
                      impossible to access. This is a normal
                      human reaction to being challenged. The
                      very fact that we continue to do this after
                      so many of us have suffered so greatly
                      indicates that this is a very strong driving
                      force. When this finally becomes recognized
                      as a positive thing, perhaps we'll really be
                      able to learn from each other. 

                 8. What, in general, do you think attracts
                 people to hacking? 

                      People have always been attracted to
                      adventure and exploration. Never before
                      have you been able to get this without
                      leaving your house and without regard to
                      your skin color, religion, sex, or even the
                      sound of your voice. On the Internet,
                      everyone is an equal until they prove
                      themselves to be a moron. And even then,
                      you can always start over. It's the ability
                      to go anywhere, talk to anyone, and not
                      reveal your personal information unless you
                      choose to -- or don't know enough not to
                      -- that most attracts people to the hacker
                      culture, which is slowly becoming the
                      Internet culture. 

                      We find that many "mainstream" people
                      share the values of hackers -- the value of
                      free speech, the power of the individual
                      against the state or the corporation, and
                      the overall sense of fun that we embrace.
                      Look in any movie where an individual is
                      fighting a huge entity, and who does the
                      audience without exception identify with?
                      Even if the character breaks the rules, most
                      people want him/her to succeed because
                      the individual is what it's all about. 

                 9. Do you know enough hackers personally to
                 know what personality traits they share, if
                 any? 

                      Hackers come from all different backgrounds
                      and have all kinds of lifestyles. They aren't
                      the geeks you see on television or the
                      cyberterrorists you see in Janet Reno news
                      conferences. They range in age from under
                      10 to over 70. They exist in all parts of the
                      world, and one of the most amazing and
                      inspiring things is to see what happens
                      when they come together. It's all about
                      technology, the thrill of discovery, and
                      sharing information. That supersedes any
                      personality issues that might be an issue in
                      other circumstances. 

                 10. Do you think hackers are productive and
                 serve a useful purpose? 

                      I think hackers are necessary, and the
                      future of technology and society itself
                      (freedom, privacy, etc.) hinges on how we
                      address the issues today that hackers are
                      very much a part of. This can be the
                      dawning of a great era. It can also be the
                      beginning of true hell. 

                 11. What percentage would you say are
                 destructive as opposed to those in it out of
                 intellectual curiosity or to test their skills? 

                      This raises several points that I feel
                      strongly about. For one thing, hacking is
                      the only field where the media believes
                      anyone who says they're a hacker. Would
                      you believe someone who said they were a
                      cop? Or a doctor? Or an airline pilot? Odds
                      are they'd have to prove their ability at
                      some point or say something that obviously
                      makes some degree of sense. But you can
                      walk up to any reporter and say you're a
                      hacker and they will write a story about
                      you telling the world that you're exactly
                      what you say you are without any real
                      proof. 

                      So every time a movie like "Hackers" comes
                      out, 10 million people from AOL send us
                      e-mail saying they want to be hackers, too,
                      and suddenly, every 12-year-old with this
                      sentiment instantly becomes a hacker in
                      the eyes of the media and hence, the rest
                      of society. You don't become a hacker by
                      snapping your fingers. It's not about getting
                      easy answers or making free phone calls or
                      logging into someone else's computer.
                      Hackers "feel" what they do, and it excites
                      them. 

                      I find that if the people around you think
                      you're wasting your time but you genuinely
                      like what you're doing, you're driven by it,
                      and you're relentless in your pursuit, you
                      have a good part of a hacker in you. But if
                      you're mobbed by people who are looking
                      for free phone calls, software or exploits,
                      you're just an opportunist, possibly even a
                      criminal. We already have words for these
                      people and it adequately defines what they
                      do. While it's certainly possible to use
                      hacking ability to commit a crime, once you
                      do this you cease being a hacker and
                      commence being a criminal. It's really not a
                      hard distinction to make. 

                      Now, we have a small but vocal group who
                      insist on calling anyone they deem
                      unacceptable in the hacker world a
                      "cracker." This is an attempt to solve the
                      problem of the misuse of the word "hacker"
                      by simply misusing a new word. It's a very
                      misguided, though well-intentioned, effort.
                      The main problem is that when you make up
                      such a word, no further definition is
                      required. When you label someone with a
                      word that says they're evil, you never really
                      find out what the evil was to begin with.
                      Murderer, that's easy. Burglar, embezzler,
                      rapist, kidnapper, all pretty clear. Now
                      along comes cracker and you don't even
                      know what the crime was. It could be
                      crashing every computer system in
                      Botswana. Or it could be copying a single
                      file. We need to avoid the labeling and start
                      looking at what we're actually talking
                      about. But at the same time, we have to
                      remember that you don't become a hacker
                      simply because you say you are. 

                 12. Do people stay in hacking a long time, or
                 is it the kind of thing that people do for a few
                 years and then move on to something else? 

                      It can be either. I tend to believe that it's
                      more of a philosophy, a way of looking at
                      something. When you have the hacker
                      perspective, you see potential where others
                      don't. Also, hackers think of things like
                      phones, computers, pagers, etc., as toys
                      and things to be enjoyed whereas others
                      see work and responsibility and actually
                      come to dread these things. That's why
                      hackers like to hold onto their world and not
                      become part of the mainstream. But it
                      certainly can and does happen. 

                 13. What is the future of hacking? 

                      As long as the human spirit is alive, there
                      will always be hackers. We may have a hell
                      of a fight on our hands if we continue to be
                      imprisoned and victimized for exploring, but
                      that will do anything but stop us. 

                 14. Given increased attention to corporate
                 and government security, is it getting
                 tougher to hack or not? 

                      Hacking isn't really about success -- it's
                      more the process of discovery. Even if real
                      security is implemented, there will always
                      be new systems, new developments, new
                      vulnerabilities. Hackers are always going to
                      be necessary to the process and we're not
                      easily bored. 

                 15. Is the possibility of being identified and
                 even prosecuted an issue for most hackers? 

                      Hackers make very bad criminals. This is
                      why we always wind up being prosecuted.
                      We don't hide very well or keep our mouths
                      sealed shut to protect corporate or
                      government interests. But the same
                      security holes would exist even if we
                      weren't around, so I think the hackers
                      should be properly seen as messengers.
                      That doesn't mean that you should expect
                      them to just hand over all of their
                      knowledge -- it's important to listen and
                      interpret on your own, as any hacker
                      would. 

                 16. Are there hackers who are up for hire?
                 What are they paid? Who hires them, and for
                 what? 

                      Just as you can use hacker ability to attain
                      a life of crime, you can use that ability to
                      become a corporate success. Some are
                      able to hold onto their hacker ideals.
                      Others, sadly, lose them. It's especially
                      hard when young people who haven't
                      worked it all out yet are approached and
                      tempted with huge amounts of money by
                      these entities. It can be very hard to resist
                      and the cost is often greater than
                      anticipated. 

                 17. Have you had any contact with people
                 you consider cyberterrorists? Do you endorse
                 what they do? 

                      In all of the time I've been in the scene,
                      which is a pretty long time, I've never come
                      across anyone I consider to be a
                      "cyberterrorist," whatever that is. Most
                      people who talk of such creatures either
                      have something to sell or some bill to pass.
                      This is not to say that such a concept is
                      impossible. But I believe the current
                      discussions aren't based in reality and have
                      very suspicious ulterior motives. 

                 18. What about the people who hack into
                 Pentagon sites? Do you think they should be
                 punished? 

                      According to the Pentagon, there is no risk
                      of anything classified being compromised
                      because it's not on the Internet. If they
                      were wrong, I would like to see someone
                      prove that. If a non-classified site is
                      hacked, I don't see the harm unless
                      something is damaged in some way.
                      Remember, the security hole was already
                      there. If a hacker finds it, it's far more likely
                      the people running the system will learn of
                      the hole. If a criminal or someone with an
                      ulterior motive (espionage, etc.) finds the
                      hole first, it's likely to remain secret for
                      much longer and the harm will be far
                      greater. 

                      While you may resent the fact that some
                      14-year-old from Topeka proved your
                      security sucks, think of what could have
                      happened had you not learned of this and
                      had someone else done it instead. I'm the
                      first to say that people who cause damage
                      should be punished, but I really don't think
                      prison should be considered for something
                      like this unless the offender is a true risk to
                      society. The great majority of these cases
                      do not involve damage or vandalism, a fact
                      that largely goes unreported. What people
                      have to remember is that most of the time,
                      this is simply an example of kids being kids
                      and playing games like they have always
                      done. 

                      Obviously, the tools have changed, but
                      that's really not something the kids are
                      responsible for. If some kid somewhere can
                      access your medical records or your phone
                      records, he or she is not the one who put
                      them there. The true violator of your
                      privacy is the person who made the
                      decision to make them easily accessible. 

                 19. Your real name is Eric Corley. Why do you
                 use the name Emmanuel Goldstein? 

                      I believe everyone should be given the
                      opportunity to name themselves. That
                      name should reflect something about who
                      you are and what you believe in and stand
                      for. Emmanuel Goldstein is that for me, and
                      for those who want to learn why, get a
                      copy of George Orwell's "1984" and see for
                      yourself. Interestingly, our first issue of
                      2600 was published in January 1984. A
                      complete coincidence.

BEN & JERRY'S SAVES MONEY, ADVANCES OFF-BEAT 
CORPORATE CULTURE

Clear-channel T-1 video conferencing service links company 
sites

Where else but at Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream would you find a 
"Communications Queen?" What other corporate headquarters
features blue jeans as the style of choice? And where else 
would you find people actually having -- brace yourself -- 
fun with their video conferencing system? OK, where else 
outside of California?

The fact is, employees at Ben & Jerry's corporate 
headquarters in Waterbury, Vermont and their colleagues at 
the company's Springfield, Vermont manufacturing site some 
74 miles away, have time for fun because their serious 
video conferencing time is so productive.


The system, which is based on PictureTel hardware and a 
New England Telephone Superpathsm 1.5M bps T-1 line, provides 
special advantages for a company based in such a rural and 
rugged location.

"Video conferencing allows us to meet more frequently
without interrupting our schedules," says Communications 
Coordinator (a.k.a."Communications Queen") Maureen Martin. 
"And, as we get into winter, it will get used even more, 
helping us avoid the drive between Waterbury and Springfield, 
which is about an hour-and-a-half."

LIVE, FROM "THE FOOTBALL FIELD"

A typical Ben & Jerry's video conference includes between 10 
and 13 people. However, sometimes high-ranking company 
officials will use the system for one-on-one meetings. 
Although two rooms at the Waterbury headquarters site are 
wired for video conferencing, the conference room (referred 
to affectionately as "The Football Field"), with its circular 
tables and room-length "white board" is the site of choice.


There are two cameras in the room. One is fixed on top of 
one of the system's 32-inch monitors, and the other sits on
a tripod that can be automatically moved to focus on fixed 
settings such as the white board or speakers. The monitor has 
a small "window" that allows the transmitting site to see 
what's coming out at the other end. There are no special 

unit's keyboard, from which it comfortably picks up commentary 
from anyplace in the room.

The system uses a clear-channel T-1 configuration, which 
allocates 64K bps for each of the 12 channels dedicated to
video transmission. Another 10 of the remaining 12 channels 
are used as voice tie lines between the two locations.

According to telecommunications specialist Melody Plante, 
"Another channel is used to transmit data, eliminating the
dedicated 56K bps line we had. We're leaving the last channel 
open, anticipating future growth."


THE VIRTUAL OFFICE IS CREATED

On the voice side of this configuration, the Springfield 
location is a virtual extension of the Waterbury site, 
meaning there are no toll charges for calls made between 
them. This also means anyone at the Waterbury site can be 
paged from Springfield. This virtual extension also creates 
a phone-mail system between the two sites.

Plante says that an initial bandwidth problem was solved when 
New England Telephone agreed to supply the clear-channel T-1 
link. Beyond that, the major obstacles consisted of getting 
all the participating vendors to decide on dip switch settings 
and video parameters. Those vendors included New England 
Telephone, PictureTel, GTE, the Southern Vermont Telephone 
Company and Telesource, a muliplexer manufacturer.

Plante lauds the role played by New England Telephone
technicians, who acted as "testers." "All the vendors relied 
heavily on New England Telephone," Plante states. "They were 
great."


Savings accumulated via reduced toll and private line charges 
will enable the multiplexer unit, which was installed during 
March of 1992, to pay for itself within 14 months. The 
system's value increases even more when time and travel 
expenses are factored in.

POSSIBLE BOSTON CONNECTION

Martin says the Ben & Jerry's video conference system will 
reach out beyond Vermont. "Eventually, we will want to hook
up with outside video conference users, such as our attorneys 
in Boston," she notes.

A visitor need not go beyond the reception area of the 
Waterbury headquarters building to get, ahem, a flavor of 
the Ben & Jerry's corporate culture.  Every wall is plastered 
with some brightly colored piece of Ben & Jerry's bric-a-brac.




The video conferencing system can be an inadvertent 
purveyor of this color culture. "One time when we got done 
with a conference, somebody in Springfield noticed that we 
had a new promotional piece on the table," Martin remembers. 
"It had just come out that morning, but they wanted to get it 
as soon as possible."

And just where does the fun, what is known within the company
as "Ben & Jerry-izing" it, come in? Although such activitiies
are not yet observed on a company-wide basis via video 
conferencing, "We've done everything from Barry Manilow's 
birthday to Elvis day,"  Martin observes. It seems only 
fitting that the Queen of Telecommunications would commemorate 
the King of Rock and Roll.

Hackers under attack
-----------------------
Crackdown raises questions about new forms of speech
-----------------------
by Mark Leccese

	The First and Fourth Amendments (ensuring free speech and 
protection against unreasonable search and seizure) became dust in 
the wind on March 1, in Austin, Texas, when US Secret Service busted 
Steve Jackson Games for no reason anyone can explain. The firm was 
preparing to market a Dungeons and Dragons-type game called GURPS 
Cyberpunk when the feds raided its headquarters, seized the 
computers the company was using both to create the game and 
maintain a computer-bulletin-board system (BBS) for dialog with its 
customers. The feds also confiscated software, company records and 
all available drafts of the book. Law enforcement officials even tried 
to pry open locked file cabinets with letter openers they found on 
employees' desks.

	And yet, as Jackson told the Phoenix, "No one connected with 
the business was ever arrested, charged, indicted or even questioned" 
after the raid, which put the company temporarily out of business.

	Steve Jackson Games appears to have been an early-year victim 
of a federal war against "hackers" - persons who gain unauthorized 
access to other people's computers - that began with a raid in Arizona 
on May 8 and escalated into a nationwide sweep known as Operation 
SunDevil covering 14 cities and involving more than 150 Secret 
Service agents.

	As John Perry Barlow, a Wyoming rancher, expert on computer 
hackers, and long time lyricist for the Grateful Dead ("I Need a 
Miracle," "Hell in a Bucket," "Mexicali Blues"), sees it, computer abuse 
can be divided into three categories: crimes committed by insiders; 
crimes committed by hackers who steal, say, credit card numbers and 
long distance phone codes; and gaining of access - just for the purpose 
of looking around and learning - by computer "phreaks."

	Everyone agrees that the first two are crimes, including the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an organization co-founded by 
Barlow and Mitchell Kapor, the Cambridge-based wizard who designed 
Lotus 1-2-3, to educate the public and the country's leaders about the 
electronic world, lobby for change, and when necessary take legal 
action such as filing friend-of-the-court briefs. The controversy 
surrounds the third category of abuse, which many hackers 
characterize as harmless high-tech fun. "The government is drawing 
no distinction" between these kinds of activities, says Barlow.

	The Secret Service held the confiscated material for three 
months while Jackson tried, in vain, to find out why it had been seized 
in the first place. According to attorney Sharon Beckman, of the Boston 
law firm Silvergate & Good, which represents the company, the 
government's application for a search warrant - which would describe 
what its agents were after - has never been released. "So far, I haven't 
heard anything to indicate probable cause," she says.

	The only thing a search warrant authorizes government agents 
to seize, Beckman contends, is information relating directly to a crime 
or a criminal conspiracy. The kind of "fishing expedition" conducted at 
Steve Jackson Games, she says, "is against the Forth Amendment" of 
the US Constitution.

	After Jackson wrote to his congressmen and, with his lawyers, 
applied pressure on the feds, most, but not all, of the property was 
returned - some of it badly damaged. "There's one computer I'm not 
even going to turn on unless I have a fire extinguisher handy," he 
says.

	During the time the government was holding on to Steve 
Jackson Games' equipment, the small business had to lay off eight of 
its 25 employees, none of whom have been rehired. "They cost us an 
awful lot of money with their little visit," Jackson says.

	All this apparently for a fantasy game with imaginary futuristic 
weapons - one Beckman describes as akin to "as James Bond movie. 
James Bond has all kinds of special tools, too, but the government 
doesn't close down James Bond movies because they could teach 
people physical-trespass skills."

	Says Jackson of the government gumshoes: "These people don't 
have enough expertise to tell fantasy from reality."

	The Jackson raid and the Operation SunDevil forays represent 
the fed's opening gambit is what many worry could be a major civil-
liberties debacle. The culprits in these Kafka-esque trials are the ever-
proliferating digital electronic impulses carried across what is known 
to computer aficionados as "the net," or, to sci-fi fans, "Cyberspace" or 
the "virtual" world - a vast and complex web of computer networks 
that make up the electronic frontier, where nothing exists in physical 
form but the hardware used to translate the bleeps into information.

	The frontier is unmapped, confusing, and infinitely expandable. 
Like the 19th-century American frontier, it is populated mostly by 
earnest settlers searching for new knowledge, but it also has its share 
of fringe characters and desperados taking advantage of the wide-
open spaces. With the advent of electronic mail, BBS's and publications 
that never put ink on paper, technology has out-paced the law. Forty 
years ago the government saw a Red under every bed; now it sees a 
hacker behind each keyboard. Over the past two years, the lawmen, 
led by the US Secret Service, have come crashing across the plains, 
dispensing frontier justice. Some actual criminals have been arrested 
and convicted, but the government, in its zealousness and ignorance of 
this new land, has also rounded up many innocent computer users 
and, in the process, trampled constitutional rights.

	Notes Kapor, "We get into trouble when we blindly try to apply 
the laws for physical media to digital media. We have to reinterpret 
what data and speech and property are."

	The Senate Judiciary Committee is now considering an 
amendment to the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act that would 
create a "recklessness" misdemeanor under which computer users who 
gain illegal access to a system and accidentally cause damage would be 
prosecuted. The EFF and the Washington based Computer Professionals 
for Social Responsibility (CPSC) both back the amendment.

	The most famous example of such "recklessness" is the case of 
Cornell graduate student Robert Morris Jr., who designed a program to 
break into the Internet system in an attempt, Barlow says, to map the 
almost unbelievably complex network (no one knows how many 
computers are hooked up to it or where they are). But the program 
written by Morris had a bug in it, and rather than mapping the 
system, it endlessly reproduced itself on computers around the 
country, temporarily bringing the Internet system to a halt. No data 
was destroyed, but valuable computing time was lost.

	"You don't want to send somebody like that to jail for 30 years 
because he wrote a bad program," Barlow says.

	Barlow - who doesn't say how he'd feel if it were his data being 
trashed - is not alone in his judgment. Surprisingly, even some in the 
corporate world that so fears and loathes the new pioneers think that 
there may be an alternative. (It is obviously in the corporate interest 
to have information - and the free flow of communication - controlled 
as tightly as possible; after all knowledge is power and power is 
money).

	Whatever else you can say about hacking, there is no question 
that it requires a gifted intellect, cleverness and hard work - all 
qualities prized and encouraged by American society. So if you can't 
stop the hackers - and no matter how hard it tries, nor how many civil 
liberties it steps on, the government doesn't seem able to - why not 
put them to good use?

	At least one expert from an unlikely quarter agrees. Dorothy E. 
Denning, of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), has prepared a paper 
to be presented to the National Computer Conference in Washington 
next month in which she recommends that she and her fellow security 
professionals "work closely with hackers."

	Denning has a truly novel idea: systems managers who obtain 
access to a supposedly secure system to leave a "calling card," 
explaining how they broke in.

	"This approach could have the advantages of not only letting the 
hackers contribute to the security of the system, but of allowing the 
managers to quickly recognize the malicious hackers, since they are 
unlikely to leave their cards. Perhaps if hackers are given the 
opportunity to make contributions outside the underground, this will 
dampen their desire to pursue illegal activities," she writes.

	It's hard to imagine the large corporations going along with this 
clever but quirky idea. "Corporations that feel they've been affected 
have voiced strong demands for government action," Kapor says. To 
wit: at least 10 corporations aided the feds in Operation SunDevil.

No sympathy for the Devil

	During Operation SunDevil numerous BBS's were shut down and 
40 computers and the equivalent of more than five million pages of 
information were swept up. Since then, there have been many more 
raids and seizures just as egregious, but they have received less 
publicity. And the campaign shows no signs of abating.

	With large corporations pressuring elected officials to take 
action, the law has its work cut out for it. There are tens of thousands 
of BBS's and national computer networks in this country, and most of 
them can be interlinked. Log on to one network, and you can travel 
the globe - and you won't be alone. According to the New York Times, 
Internet carried the equivalent of about half a trillion keyboard 
strokes in July alone.

	Anyone with a home computer and a modem can log on to a BBS 
and join discussions on, say, new computer projects and movies; copy 
"freeware" and "shareware," software in the public domain; or 
contribute to talks on topics such as ham radio, the Holocaust, good 
dinners, or travel in Europe. You can either "post" a message for all to 
read, or send private electronic mail ("e-mail") to a fellow BBS 
member or to the BBS's system operator (generally the person who's 
set up the board). If you've got some kind of computer question, just 
post it on the BBS and you'll get a dozen good suggestions.

	Or, for a fee, you can hook up to a national computer network. 
Once connected to the GEnie network (operated by General Electric), 
for example, you can, among other things, join roundtable discussions 
on subjects ranging from investments to photography, send and 
receive e-mail, play on-line games against other members, read up-to-
the-minute wire-service reports, access an encyclopedia, copy one of 
hundred of programs, get stock quotes, make airline reservations, and 
buy jewelry from Tiffany.

	In other words, you could spend the rest of your life wandering 
around the net and never retrace your steps.

	Of course, these days chances are you'll bump into some folks 
who have no business joining the club. Following a Freedom of 
Information Act request earlier this year from Representative Don 
Edwards (D-California), the Secret Service admitted to Congress that its 
agents, posing as legitimate users, were secretly monitoring BBS's. And 
though reading messages posted to the public is not illegal, 
government agents' reading and most likely making records of BBS 
conversations is "a little bit like an agent who attends a political rally 
to get information for a file," says CPSR president Marc Rotenberg.

	Barlow likens a BBS to "a village with a continuous town 
meeting in progress 24 hours a day." The US government, he says, is 
"confiscating towns."

	As federal agents scan the BBSs for criminal activity, what other 
small fish might they catch in their nets? Well, for one, the Secret 
Service, in response to Edward's FOIA request, admitted it has a new 
Computer Diagnostics Center, about which Rotenburg paints this 
frightening picture: the technology is readily available for a computer, 
purring quietly in a corner 24 hours a day, to scan electronic BBSs for 
key words like "hacking" or even key name - like yours - and dump 
every communication it finds with that word into a database. A BBS 
user, entirely unaware, could have a thousand page file on him at the 
Secret Service's disposal in a matter of weeks.

	For its part, the Secret Service denies that the agency is 
undertaking such surveillance, or will. Special agent and Washington 
Secret Service spokesman Richard Adams told the Phoenix, "The only 
folks the Secret Service is targeting are those operators who are using 
or encouraging others in the use of stolen phone-company numbers 
and stolen credit-card numbers."

	"I can assure you we're not randomly searching bulletin 
boards," he said. "We're bound by the courts. You've got to have 
probable cause, as you do in any case, to obtain a search warrant or an 
arrest warrant."

	But what constitutes probable cause? After all, hasn't the US 
Supreme Court ruled repeatedly that speech - and even "encouraging 
others," as agent Adams put it - is protected under the First 
Amendment unless it is "likely" to lead to "imminent" criminal 
activity?

	Where, for instance, was probable cause in the case of the 
much-publicized Phrack imbroglio? Which raises an even more 
ominous consideration: does corporate status play a role in 
determining it?

	Say you are a publisher into whose system a stolen document 
falls (a circumstance roughly equivalent to someone's dropping 
purloined papers on a newspapers editor's desk). You publish it. What 
happens to you and your publication?

	If you are Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, 
you publish the Pentagon Papers. The government tries to take action 
against you, but the courts, citing First Amendment, stand foursquare 
behind you.

	If you are Craig Neirdorf, publisher of Phrack, an electronic 
newsletter covering the hackers' world, you, too, publish a stolen 
document. You are arrested by the Secret Service, hit with a seven-
count grand-jury indictment, and the equipment you use to publish - 
along with all your files - is seized. Your publication is out of business.

	Phrack's document was an internal BellSouth memorandum 
describing the company's 911 emergency system. In elegant 
bureaucratese, the document was titled " A Bell South Standard 
Practice (BSP) 660-225-104SV-Control Office Administration of 
Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major Account Centers, 
March 1988." It was plucked from BellSouth's computers and dropped 
into Neirdorf's system, among others, by a hacker named Robert Riggs, 
who was indicted and pleaded guilty to this and other incidents of 
illegal entry. In February 1989, Neidorf, a 20-year-old University of 
Missouri student, included the three-page document in Phrack. 
BellSouth claimed the document was worth exactly $79,449 and by 
being made public could cause potentially fatal disruption of its 911 
system. Neidorf was busted and indicted on felony charges that 
included interstate transmission of stolen goods. Earlier this month, 
the prosecuting US Attorney dropped the charges against Neidorf after 
his attorney proved that all the information in the document was 
already in the public domain and that contained much of the same 
data as the stolen one - and that went into more detail - could be 
obtained by calling an 800 number and paying $13. Neidorf's lawyers 
are considering a civil suit against the government. Neidorf, now in his 
senior year, has no plans to publish another issue of Phrack "in the 
near future," says his attorney.

	According to attorney Beckman, the government was "blaming 
Phrack for what other people might do with the information it would 
publish... It's like a newspaper publishing an article about home 
security systems that someone would use to break into a house."

	"I don't think the government even thought through the First 
Amendment implications," she says.

	Not to mention corporate fallout. As Steve Jackson sees it, "The 
Times was only going up against the military-industrial complex. 
Neidorf pulled the nose of the phone company."

	Sheldon Zenner, the Chicago attorney who represented Neidorf, 
says the legal issue raised by the Phrack case - an illegally obtained 
document appearing on a BBS and the government then seizing the 
BBS - is likely to recur. The Secret Service's press release announcing 
the Operation SunDevil raid calls computer users who gain illegal 
access "a frightening threat" and states that their actions have "serious 
implications for the health and welfare of all individuals, corporations, 
and United States Government agencies relying on computers and 
telephones to communicate." To back up its assertions, the feds add 
that the telephone companies put their losses to stolen phone service 
"as high as 50 million dollars" and that hackers have had access to 
hospital records and "could have added, deleted, or altered vital 
patient information, possibly causing life-threatening situations." As 
Barlow points out, that's a mighty big "could" - especially since no one 
has ever proven that a single patient record has ever been altered by 
a hacker.

	Why do the powers-that-be so fear BBSs? Mark Worthington, of 
Cambridge's MacEast BBS, posted a message saying it's out of 
ignorance, "but I also think they fear them for a much more troubling 
reason. They rightly perceive BBSs as a place where people can 
congregate and communicate without physically meeting... A BBS 
represents the electronic First Amendment right of free assembly, and 
thus constitutes a political threat to the paranoid and powerful."

	Perhaps the most troubling example of the government's blind 
zeal concerns the Jolnet BBS, in Illinois. Its operator, Richard Andrews, 
discovered in storage on his system (again, thanks to Riggs) the 
infamous 911 document that Phrack later published. He suspected 
something illegal and asked the advice of a friend, who notified the 
phone company in an effort to set things right. Government agents 
shut down the Jolnet BBS and seized Andrew's equipment last 
December; they still have yet to return any equipment or to charge 
Andrews.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse

	It was not only Operation SunDevil and the surrounding spate of 
arrests that prompted Barlow to get in touch with Kapor and found 
EFF. Barlow's visit from a technically illiterate FBI agent, which he 
recounts in his article "Crime & Puzzlement" in the fall issue of The 
Whole Earth Review, sealed in his mind the need to take action.

	"It's not until you get your own visit from an FBI agent that you 
realize this isn't an abstract problem," Barlow says. "I came to the 
realization the government was now dealing with things it didn't 
understand."

	Barlow spent two hours with the FBI agent who'd come to 
question him, most of it explaining how computers and networks 
operate. "He took to rubbing his face with both hands, peering up over 
his fingertips, and saying, 'It sure is something, isn't it?' or 'Whoooo-
eee,'" Barlow writes in his story. "Or:'My eight-year-old knows more 
about these things than I do.' He didn't say this with a father's pride 
so much as an immigrant's fear of a strange new land into which he 
will be forcibly moved and in which his own child is native. He looked 
across my keyboard into Cyberspace and didn't like what he saw."

	Kapor and Steve Wozniak, the iconoclastic co-founder of Apple 
Computers, put up the seed money to establish EFF, which has already 
issued its first grant: $275,000 to the Computing and Civil Liberties 
Project of the CPSR. The EFF has filed a freind-of-the-court brief in the 
Neidorf case, and has hired Silverglate & Good to clarify and articulate 
the civil-liberties issue at stake on the electronic frontier.

	Kapor is clear about what the EFF is not. "It's not a hacker-
defense fund," he stresses. "Legally, the big thing now is to figure out 
what we're going to do about these BBS seizures and the reading of 
[electronic] mail" by the Secret Service.

	The EFF's purpose, Kapor says, "is to try to ensure that in a new 
scheme, the public networks will be universal and open, encouraging 
informational entrepreneurship."

	The "hacker ethic," as it was so brilliantly described by Stephen 
Levy in his seminal 1984 book Hackers, is about learning, not stealing. 
(Thus serious hackers' insistence on the term "crackers" for law-
breakers.)

	"When a hacker breaks into a system, the objective is to learn 
and avoid causing damage," DEC's Denning wrote in her paper, 
"Downloaded information [electronically transferred to the hacker's 
computer] is copied, not stolen, and still exists on the original system. 
Moreover, information has traditionally not been regarded as 
property."

Future Shock?

	No matter what the corporations or the feds want, or what 
restrictive steps they may take, Cyberspace isn't going to go away. If 
anything, it will expand. One prominent Apple researcher recently 
predicted that within a few years home computers "50 times more 
powerful" than those now on the market will be available.

	Moreover, the networks themselves are expected to become 
more accessible to the general public. To those ends US Senator Albert 
Gore (D-Tennessee) has proposed in Congress a $1.75 billion bill that 
would fund a supernet to link the nation's universities and 
supercomputers.

	Gore's bill is considered a step toward a nascent high-speed 
national computer network that could potentially reach every home in 
the country. Such a network, the New York Times noted on September 
2, could trigger a "technological transformation that will be every bit 
as profound for America in the next century as the transcontinental 
railroad was in the last." Such a network would cost an estimated $200 
billion.

	Surprisingly, sometimes there is encouraging news from the top 
brass themselves. President George Bush last month removed 
restrictions the previous administration had placed on computer 
access to non-classified federal databases and information collected by 
university researchers and private firms working with the 
government.

	Given this rapid expansion of boundaries, decisions about how 
civil liberties will be protected in a world the Bill of Rights' authors 
could never have foreseen must be made now, by the courts and the 
government. The law-enforcement community and corporations have 
so far shown no sign of letting up their technophobic campaign, and, 
with a few exceptions, civil libertarians seem slow to wake up to the 
issue. The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, has yet to be 
heard from in the Operation SunDevil debate, though it has formed a 
subcommittee on technology.

	The EFF, in its mission statement, recognizes the lack of law and 
legal precedent in the electronic frontier and warns that "in their 
absence, law-enforcement agencies like the Secret Service and FBI, 
acting at the disposal of large information corporations, are seeking to 
create legal precedents which would radically limit Constitutional 
application to digital media."

	"The excesses of Operation SunDevil are only the beginning of 
what threatens to become a long, difficult, and philosophically obscure 
struggle between institutional control and individual liberty."
